# recognEYEz - Build your own face recognition apps with ease and privacy!

recognEYEz is a software intended to fill the gap for makers and DIY smart home owners who would like to build functionality on face recognition with privacy (without additional programming). recognEYEz runs on a Raspberry Pi extended with a camera module, and makes all the computations on the device (images and faces are not uploaded anywhere!). The software can be controlled easily by a web interface, and in order to make a connection with existing systems and services, email notifications and the MQTT protocol can be used.
